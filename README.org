Available as the =transmission= package on MELPA <http://melpa.org/>
and marmalade <https://marmalade-repo.org/>.

One can install as a package with

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/transmission.el RET
#+END_SRC

Otherwise, for installing into one's =load-path=, a system install,
etc., do the usual

#+BEGIN_SRC
make
make install
#+END_SRC

* Setup

The customizables =transmission-host=, =transmission-service=, and
=transmission-rpc-path= are used for the URL to communicate with a
Transmission RPC server.  The defaults reflect the URL
<http://localhost:9091/transmission/rpc>. Also, there is
=transmission-rpc-auth= for setting a username and password.

To see the rest of the customizable variables, do

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x customize-group RET transmission RET
#+END_SRC
